# Web-View-Automator
This is a script for automating views of a webpage for marketing/SEO purposes. I am in the process of packaging this as a native Windows and Mac program. 

Requirements: 
- Python 3.5 or higher 
- Knowledge of how to run a python script. 

Instructions: 

1. Run the "set_up.py" script. This installs the external modules that the main script uses. 

2. Run the "Web View Automator.py" script 

3. Select "start" in the pop up window 

4. (optional, but reccommended) Enter HTTP and HTTPS proxies. To find a list of free proxies, please visit https://incloak.com/proxy-list/

5. Enter a URL with in https:// format 

6. Enter the number of views you want to perform. 

7. Hit ok 

8. The program will ask you if you would like to continue, if you want to run the script again, hit continue. If you are finished, hit exit.
